# VS Code Cache Clear Instructions

## Issue
VS Code is showing TypeScript errors for a file that has been deleted (`DashboardPageSimplified.tsx`).

## Solution
The errors are from VS Code's cached language server. Here are steps to clear them:

### Method 1: Command Palette
1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Run: "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
3. Or run: "Developer: Reload Window"

### Method 2: VS Code Settings
1. Close VS Code completely
2. Reopen the workspace
3. The cache should be cleared

### Method 3: Clear TypeScript Cache Manually
1. Close VS Code
2. Delete the `.vscode` folder (if it exists) in the workspace root
3. Reopen VS Code

## Verification
Run these commands to verify everything is working:

```bash
# TypeScript check (should pass with no errors)
npx tsc --noEmit

# Build check (should pass)
npm run build

# Lint check (should pass)
npm run lint
```

## Current Status
✅ All actual compilation and build processes are working correctly
✅ The problematic file has been successfully deleted
✅ No real TypeScript errors exist in the codebase

The reported errors are phantom errors from VS Code's cache and do not affect the actual build or functionality.
